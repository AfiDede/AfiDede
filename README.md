## Hi I'm Kweyakie <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="28px" alt="hi">

### I am a Data Analyst, Technology Auditor, Technical Writer and Social Entrepreneur.
<br >
My interests lie in being able to conduct an in-depth analysis of data, recognise relevant patterns and drawing conclusions and making recommendations that solve business problems and communicate complex ideas to non-technical stakeholders. 
<br >
This has influenced me to write technical articles on topics I find interesting in my learning.
<br >
My goal is to explain concepts in Data Science and Analytics, Machine Learning and Python programming in way that absolute beginners can understand.
<br >
I contribute to Open Source at - [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/)
